"""info from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store
data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single
value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided
in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a
Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a
‘comma’.

A Dictionary in Python works similar to the Dictionary in a real world.
Keys of a Dictionary must be unique and of immutable data type such as
Strings, Integers and tuples, but the key-values can be repeated and be
of any type."""
